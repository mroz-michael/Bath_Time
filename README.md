This project was built in 2 days by 5 Second Year Dalhousie Computer Science Students (Jan. 2025)
as our submission for the Global Game Jam 2025.

The theme of this year's jam was "Bubbles" and we created our game using Godot, GDScript.

Our game is about cleaning a stereotypical Computer Science student (cuz we smell..), and our art
was inspired by South Park.  

[+]: Setting up

+ Open the link here to download our game: https://globalgamejam.org/games/2025/bath-time-5

+ Unpack the .zip file and run "Bath Time.exe" to play! Alt+f4 to close the game, or alt+tab to
switch windows and close it.

[+]: How to play

+ You'll start by trying to scrub the student as quick as possible, filling up the clean meter.
If he gets angry (i.e. angry meter bar goes up), calm him down by letting him play minigames on his
tablet. 

+ The better you perform in the minigames, the more time you'll have to clean him, without him getting 
angry again >:(
